In this project there are functions and programs to manipulate and plot climate data. I develop this project for personal interest, and it is also partly related to my activities as researcher and data scientist. The codes are written with the R programming language. This project can be interesting and useful to geographers, climatologists, ecologists, agricultural/forest/environmental engineers, as well as to students, academics and teachers.

There is a user manual ("read_me") for each function or program.

Functions:

climatab.R

climawindow.R

join_climatabwin.R


Programs:

Climaplot.R
