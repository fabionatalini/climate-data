In this project there are functions to manipulate climate data.

The codes are written with the R programming language. The source files are climatab.R, climawindow.R and join_climatabwin.R

There is a user manual ("read_me") for each function: please check the user manuals for further details about each function.

Thank you for your interest in this project.
